This is a small tool to keep the database up to date with the repository scripts.

Step to set it up :
-------------------
1. Run create_structure.sql on each of your databases.
2. Edit conf.xml for your need.
3. Execute run.bat or run.sh depending to the system.

Important matters:
------------------
* The table db_mig_script will contain the process information with:
- Job name : which process handled this script
- Script name : path from the reading directory to the filename
- Status : S=Success, F=Fail, R=Rollback
- Reason : Exception message of the issue.

* If one of the script being processed is in error it will rollback the whole process.
The error script will be stored with status F and the reason of fail.
The other scripts will be stored with status R and in the reason which script is the cause.

* When the business is ran, it first check in the table if there is already a record with this script name in Success.
If this is the case, the script won't be processed as it was already processed.

* At the end of the process, the whole log is saved in log.txt

Congiration.xml structure:
--------------------------
* ConnectionURLs : Obviously that's where you define the url to the databases (with user and password in the url)
* ExclusionRules : Defines a set of exclusion rule that you can apply lower on jobs. 
They are useful to ignore some file that you have already run manually.
At the moment there is only one type of exclusion rule based on the timestamp extracted from the filename (see current conf.xml as example).
* JobDefinitions : Defines where to lookup for the files, which extension to retreive, which rules to apply.
